# Just Chattin'

## What can I watch and expect from this project?

This repository has implemented many things, such as:

- Sockets, customs rooms
- Validation with Zod, JWT, APIs
- Docker with Mongo to persist data
- Component Architecture in Frontend & Hexagonal from Backend as well
- Routing

## Needed Requirements

This project aims to be user-friendly, convenient, and easy to connect to for testing, improvement and more. To handle database queries, we've opted for MongoDB with a [Docker] image, which must be installed first.

## How to Install?

To install and run all different scripts, navigate to the Server/Client Subfoler, and read the following instructions and execute it in the terminal.

Navigate to the Server subfolder, <a href='Server'>here</a>

Navigate to the Client subfolder, <a href='Client'>here</a>

<br/>

When you are logged in, we've added mock users for you. To find them and start chatting, use the keyword search "all".

If want to use this mock users as you, put this data:

- mock-email: `john.doe@gmail.com`/ `jane.doe@gmail.com`/`kevin.doe@gmail.com`/`anne.doe@gmail.com`

- mock-password: `asdasd`

We hope you enjoy this project and feel free to conduct your own tests and make improvements!
