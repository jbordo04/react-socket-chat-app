# Server side

## How to Install and run it?

Before running the entire project, we need to install our primary depedencies. To do so, enter `npm install` in terminal.

```sh
npm install
```

To build our project (turn into .js), we just run next script.

```sh
npm run build
```

Once it is build, we can run our server build.

```sh
npm run start
```

But if you want to make changes or want run in dev (row code), type this script.

```sh
npm run dev
```
